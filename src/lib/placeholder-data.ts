// Biography text 
export const biographyContent = {
  intro: "Jaap Goedemoed (b. 1956, De Bilt) is a Dutch contemporary artist whose work spans painting, mixed media, collage, and photography. His artistic practice evolved alongside a distinguished career in pharmaceutical science, creating a unique intersection of precision, experimentation, and creative expression.",
  
  earlyLife: "Born in De Bilt, The Netherlands in 1956, Goedemoed showed early artistic talent with high marks for drawing and early experiments with screen printing and etching techniques during his high school years at Het Nieuwe Lyceum in Bilthoven (1968-1974). He later pursued Pharmacy at Groningen State University, graduating as a pharmacist in 1982, during which time he began creating his initial figurative oil paintings.",
  
  artisticDevelopment: "Goedemoed's artistic development reveals a fascinating evolution from detailed figurative paintings inspired by Egyptian culture (1984) to abstract art influenced by ethnographic art (1990). Throughout his career, he experimented with various techniques and materials including relief, tape on canvas, mixed media, and large-scale collages incorporating materials like Coptic healing scrolls, old Islamic handwritings, banknotes, and stamps. His work demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of composition, often influenced by his scientific background.",
  
  careerHighlights: "While maintaining his scientific career, Goedemoed's artistic work has been exhibited in multiple venues including New York's Montague Art Gallery (1997), Hommage Gallery in Amsterdam (1997), Galerie Ruimte in Amsterdam (2007-2008), Baut Zuid in Amsterdam (2015), Slotervaart Medical Center (2016-2017), and Italiaander Galleries in Amsterdam (2019). His work has also been prominently displayed at the RIVM (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment), where he served as a member of the Art Commission from 2005 to 2010.",
  
  currentPractice: "Goedemoed continues his work as a pharmaceutical assessor at the Medicines Evaluation Board of The Netherlands while maintaining his artistic practice. His dual career as both scientist and artist creates a unique synergy in his work, bringing analytical precision and experimental methodology to his creative expression. He has published several art books including 'Tramways d'Odessa' (2008) and 'Artworks Jaap Goedemoed â Selection of works 1984-2018' (2018)."

// Artist statement for Info page
export const artistStatement = "My work explores the intersections between architectural space, memory, and perception. Through a process that combines photographic documentation, painting, and mixed media approaches, I investigate how built environments shape our experience and how they persist in memory after direct encounter. The tension between structure and atmosphere, between the precise and the ephemeral, drives my practice. I am particularly interested in liminal spacesâthresholds, transitions, and boundariesâwhere different conditions meet and transform one another. Working primarily with painting and photography, I develop compositions that exist in a space between abstraction and representation, inviting viewers to navigate familiar forms that resist complete identification.";

// Process description for Info page
export const processDescription = "My working process typically begins with photographic documentation of architectural spaces, urban environments, or landscape features that serve as reference material and conceptual starting points. These images are then transformed through a painting process that involves multiple layers, often combining precise geometric elements with more atmospheric and gestural approaches. I frequently work in series, developing variations on particular themes or structural motifs. Materials and techniques are selected based on their conceptual and expressive potential for each body of work, ranging from traditional oil painting to experimental approaches incorporating natural pigments, photographic elements, and found materials.";

// Ethnographic influence for Info page
export const ethnographicInfluence = "My approach is informed by an ethnographic sensibilityâa deep attention to how spaces are inhabited, transformed, and given meaning through human activity. Influences from Dutch architectural traditions, particularly the legacy of De Stijl and structural rationalism, are evident in my compositional strategies. The works of Douglas Hofstadter on the nature of consciousness and pattern recognition, as well as the poetic observations of Hans Lodeizen on the nature of perception, have been significant philosophical touchstones for my practice. These influences converge in work that examines how built structures embody cultural values and how they shape both collective and personal memory.";
