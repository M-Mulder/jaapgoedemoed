# Artwork Gallery Updates

## Overview of Changes

We've completed a comprehensive update to the artwork gallery for Jaap Goedemoed's website. The updates include:

1. **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate artwork files across different folders, ensuring each artwork appears only once in its proper category.

2. **Website Assets Organization**: Created a dedicated "Website Assets" folder with subdirectories for Hero Images and Icons, separating website-specific assets from actual artworks.

3. **Comprehensive Artwork Data**: Generated a complete artwork database that includes all artworks from all folders, with proper categorization, descriptions, and metadata.

4. **Updated Website Code**: Modified the website code to use the new comprehensive artwork data, ensuring all artworks are properly displayed in the gallery.

## Details of Changes

### 1. Duplicate Removal

We identified several duplicate files across different folders:
- Duplicates in the "Interviuw" folder that existed in their proper category folders
- Redundant files with different naming conventions in the "Old stock paper Artworks" folder
- Duplicate files between year folders (2018, 2019, etc.) and category folders

All duplicates were backed up to `public/temp_cleanup/duplicates_backup/` before removal.

### 2. Website Assets Organization

We created a new organization structure for website assets:
- `public/Website Assets/Hero Images/`: Contains hero images used on the website
- `public/Website Assets/Icons/`: Contains SVG icons used throughout the website

This separation makes it easier to manage website assets separately from actual artwork images.

### 3. Comprehensive Artwork Data

We generated a new data file (`src/lib/updated-artwork-data.ts`) that includes:
- 276 unique artworks from all folders
- Proper categorization (abstract, figurative, paper, joyce, porcupine, youth, others)
- Consistent metadata (title, year, medium, dimensions, description)
- Accurate image paths

The new data structure maintains all the existing interfaces and exports, ensuring compatibility with the existing codebase.

### 4. Updated Website Code

We updated the import statements in the following files to use the new artwork data:
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/artworks/page.tsx`
- `src/app/artworks/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/info/serious-art-piece/page.tsx`
- `src/app/artworks/composition-2017/page.tsx`
- `src/app/artworks/composition-no-2-2022/page.tsx`
- `src/app/artworks/porcupine-artworks/page.tsx`

## Maintenance Scripts

We've created several PowerShell scripts to help maintain the artwork collection:

1. **cleanup_duplicates.ps1**: Analyzes the artwork collection to identify duplicate files
2. **remove_duplicates.ps1**: Removes identified duplicate files with backups
3. **check_new_content.ps1**: Analyzes new content organization
4. **generate_artwork_data.ps1**: Generates comprehensive artwork data from all folders
5. **update_imports.ps1**: Updates import statements in website code

These scripts can be run periodically to maintain the artwork collection as new content is added.

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Consistent Naming Convention**: Use a standard format like "Title YYYY, dimensions.jpg" for all artwork files
2. **Dual Organization**: For new artworks, consider placing them both in year folders and category folders
3. **Website Assets Management**: Continue to separate website-specific assets from actual artworks
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Run the cleanup scripts periodically to identify and remove new duplicates

## Conclusion

The artwork gallery now includes all artworks from all folders, properly categorized and without duplicates. The website code has been updated to use the new comprehensive artwork data, ensuring all artworks are properly displayed in the gallery.
