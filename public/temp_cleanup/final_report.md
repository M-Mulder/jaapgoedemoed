# Artwork Collection Cleanup Report

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Duplicate Files Removed

We identified and removed several duplicate files across the artwork collection:

- Removed duplicates from the "Interviuw" folder that existed in their proper category folders:
  - "Ancient hand writing 1997, 42 x 30 cm.png"
  - "Changing pattern with opening I 1990, 90 x 95 cm.jpg"
  - "Changing pattern with relief I 1990, 100 x 100 cm.jpg"
  - "Changing tiling on a wooden plank 1990, 60 x 200 cm.png"
  - "Composition 2014, 100 x 100 cm (2).jpg"
  - "Composition 2014, 100 x 100 cm.jpg"
  - "Division of the plane no.png"
  - "Les Tramways d'IÃ©katerinoslaw 2013, 40 x 50 cm.jpg"
  - "Les Tramways de Kiew 2013, 40 x 50 cm.jpg"

- Removed redundant files with different naming conventions from the "Old stock paper Artworks" folder:
  - "Aandeelkunstwerk-Belge-IMG_5244-8-juni-2017.png"
  - "Aandeelkunstwerk-Donetz--24-01-2019.jpg"

All removed files were backed up to the "public/temp_cleanup/duplicates_backup/" directory.

### 2. Website Assets Organized

We created a dedicated "Website Assets" folder to better organize non-artwork files:

- Created "Website Assets/Hero Images" folder and moved:
  - "hero_image_1.jpg"
  - "hero_image_2.jpg"

- Created "Website Assets/Icons" folder and moved SVG icons:
  - "file.svg"
  - "globe.svg"
  - "next.svg"
  - "vercel.svg"
  - "window.svg"

## Additional Findings

Our analysis revealed several other patterns that could be addressed in future cleanup efforts:

1. **Year-based vs. Category-based Organization**:
   - Many files exist in both year folders (2018, 2019, etc.) and category folders
   - Consider standardizing on one approach or implementing a more structured dual-organization system

2. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**:
   - File names vary significantly across the collection
   - Some use spaces, others use hyphens
   - Some include dimensions, others don't
   - Some include years in different formats

3. **Duplicate Content Across Years**:
   - Several identical files appear in different year folders
   - This suggests a need for better version control or organization

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Standardize Naming Convention**:
   - Adopt a consistent format like "Title YYYY, dimensions.jpg" for all artwork files
   - Use consistent separators (either spaces or hyphens)

2. **Implement a Clear Organization Strategy**:
   - Decide whether to organize primarily by year, by category, or both
   - If both, establish clear rules for which files go where

3. **Regular Cleanup**:
   - Run the cleanup scripts periodically to identify and remove new duplicates
   - Update the scripts as the collection grows and organization needs evolve

4. **Metadata Management**:
   - Consider implementing a metadata system (e.g., a JSON file) to track artwork details
   - This would allow for more flexible organization and searching

5. **Website Assets Management**:
   - Continue to separate website-specific assets from artwork files
   - Use clear naming conventions for website assets as well

## Next Steps

1. Review the changes made and ensure everything is working correctly
2. Consider implementing the additional recommendations
3. Update any website code that might reference the moved files
